# Finger-Counter
A program to count the number of fingers you're holding out.

# Getting Started

Simply run counter.py or tracker-counter.py. 
tracker.py is less volatile than tracker-counter.py,
but the latter is able to track the location of your hand.

# Single Shot Detector + ConvNet
tracker-counter.py
